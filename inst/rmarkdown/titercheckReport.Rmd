```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(cytovasTools)
```

## Titer Check Table

The titer check is designed to detect two events:
- Accumulation of antibody 
```{r cars}
# assume they are interested in any parameter that has an antibody
yaml.load_file("config.yaml")

```

## Longitudinal plot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
